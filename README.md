# IcarOS

- IcarOS is my documented journey while exploring OSDev
- A simple, minimal and small skeletal 32-bit operating system written in Assembly and C++
- Currently working on a Rust port

### To run, just execute the make file.
  - You can also do `./Makefile`

- As of now, it can boot and jump to the kernel and execute from there
